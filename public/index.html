                        The CHD (Compressed Hunks of Data) file format is adored by many emulation enthusiasts and gaming archivists because of its exceptional compression. However, the program used to create them is operated exclusively through a command-line interface, so it may seem daunting
                        to anyone without the technical know-how. CHDMAN was originally made for the MAME emulator to handle the hard-drive contents of certain arcade machines, but it has since been adopted by other emulators because of its lossless compression.

                        This tutorial will show you how to pack .cue, .iso and .gdi files into a .chd file, as well as how to unpack them from a .chd file.
