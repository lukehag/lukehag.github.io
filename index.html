    <pre>
    
    This site will be a blog where I talk about whatever I'm interested in.
    There will be a directory that lists out the name, date, category and rating of each blog post with a small snippet of what is written.
    The blog posts should be able to be of any length and support images/gifs between paragraphs.
    The bottom of the blog would host a comment system with the ability to favorite the blog post.
    The comment system should be able to determine different users and label them as their respective roles (i.e. author or contributor).
